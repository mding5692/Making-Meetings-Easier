# Making-Meetings-Easier
Enabling an online agenda, online calendar sync and meeting note-taking system


Meetings are often unproductive and ineffective with conflicts often arising, especially in an office surrounding.
An online agenda system, with note-taking and minutes for meetings would better facilitate a good meeting and more effective day-to-day operations.

Uses Socket.io, Nodejs, Ractivejs <br>
Probably would use Heroku to host as its a dynamic Node web app

How to use:

Sign in

Establish agenda and date. <br>
Figure out facilitator/host. <br>
